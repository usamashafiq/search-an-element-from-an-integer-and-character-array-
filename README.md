# search-an-element-from-an-integer-and-character-array-
Part 1 Write a function search that can search an element from an integer array and return its index, if element does call the search function to search for a value entered by user and print the results?  Part 2  Overload the function in q9 that can take a character array and a character to search from that array then it should find and return the index of that character case sensitively. The function should be capable of starting search from any index (make it default argument, if not passed then it should start searching from 0th index). Write a driver program and input the string from user (enter the string “Programming Fundamentals”). Find the position of first g, and then use the same function to find the position of second g, then use the same function to find position of 3rd g. and print their indexes
